                <b>Warnings:</b>  Observation of the pacing lead throughout the procedure is essential to avoid the potential
                risk of pacing lead perforation. There may be an increased risk of stroke in transcatheter aortic valve
                replacement procedures, as compared to balloon aortic valvuloplasty or other standard treatments in high
                or greater risk patients. The devices are designed, intended, and distributed for single use only. <b>Do
                not resterilize or reuse the devices.</b> There are no data to support the sterility, nonpyrogenicity, and
                functionality of the devices after reprocessing. Incorrect sizing of the valve may lead to paravalvular
                leak, migration, embolization, residual gradient (patient-prosthesis mismatch), and/or annular rupture.
                Accelerated deterioration of the valve due to calcific degeneration may occur in children, adolescents,
                or young adults and in patients with an altered calcium metabolism. Prior to delivery, the valve must
                remain hydrated at all times and cannot be exposed to solutions other than its shipping storage solution
                and sterile physiologic rinsing solution. Valve leaflets mishandled or damaged during any part of the
                procedure will require replacement of the valve. Caution should be exercised in implanting a valve in
                patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease. Patients with pre-existing prostheses
                should be carefully assessed prior to implantation of the valve to ensure proper valve positioning and
                deployment. Do not use the valve if the tamper-evident seal is broken or the storage solution does not
                completely cover the valve (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra only), the temperature indicator has been
                activated, the valve is damaged, or the expiration date has elapsed. Do not mishandle the delivery
                system or use it if the packaging or any components are not sterile, have been opened or are damaged
                (e.g., kinked or stretched), or if the expiration date has elapsed. Use of excessive contrast media may
                lead to renal failure. Measure the patient’s creatinine level prior to the procedure. Contrast media
                usage should be monitored. Patient injury could occur if the delivery system is not un-flexed prior to
                removal. Care should be exercised in patients with hypersensitivities to cobalt, nickel, chromium,
                molybdenum, titanium, manganese, silicon, and/or polymeric materials. The procedure should be conducted
                under fluoroscopic guidance. Some fluoroscopically guided procedures are associated with a risk of
                radiation injury to the skin. These injuries may be painful, disfiguring, and long-lasting. Valve
                recipients should be maintained on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, except when contraindicated, as
                determined by their physician. This device has not been tested for use without anticoagulation. Do not
                add or apply antibiotics to the storage solution (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra only), rinse solution, or
                to the valve. Balloon valvuloplasty should be avoided in the treatment of failing bioprostheses as this
                may result in embolization of bioprosthesis material and mechanical disruption of the valve leaflets. Do
                not perform stand-alone balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures in the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve for
                the sizes 19-25 mm. This may expand the valve causing aortic incompetence, coronary embolism or annular
                rupture. Transcatheter valve replacement in mitral annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of
                partial annuloplasty ring dehiscence due to high risk of PVL. Transcatheter valve replacement in mitral
                annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of partial (incomplete) annuloplasty rings in the absence
                of annular calcium due to increased risk of valve embolization. Transcatheter valve replacement in
                mitral annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of rigid annuloplasty rings due to increased risk
                of PVL or THV deformation.
<br><br>
                <b>Precautions:</b> Long-term durability has not been established for the valve. Regular medical follow-up is
                advised to evaluate valve performance. Limited clinical data are available for transcatheter aortic
                valve replacement in patients with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve who are deemed to be at low
                surgical risk. Anatomical characteristics should be considered when using the valve in this population.
                In addition, patient age should be considered as long-term durability of the valve has not been
                established. Glutaraldehyde may cause irritation of the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. Avoid prolonged or
                repeated exposure to, or breathing of, the solution. Use only with adequate ventilation. If skin contact
                occurs, immediately flush the affected area with water; in the event of contact with eyes, seek
                immediate medical attention. For more information about glutaraldehyde exposure, refer to the Safety
                Data Sheet available from Edwards Lifesciences. If a significant increase in resistance occurs when
                advancing the catheter through the vasculature, stop advancement and investigate the cause of resistance
                before proceeding. Do not force passage, as this could increase the risk of vascular complications. As
                compared to SAPIEN 3, system advancement force may be higher with the use of SAPIEN 3 Ultra/SAPIEN 3
                Ultra RESILIA THV in tortuous/challenging vessel anatomies. To maintain proper valve leaflet coaptation,
                do not overinflate the deployment balloon. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended
                post-procedure in patients at risk for prosthetic valve infection and endocarditis. Additional
                precautions for transseptal replacement of a failed mitral valve bioprosthesis include, the presence of
                devices or thrombus or other abnormalities in the caval vein precluding safe transvenous femoral access
                for transseptal approach; and the presence of an Atrial Septal Occluder Device or calcium preventing
                safe transseptal access. Special care must be exercised in mitral valve replacement to avoid entrapment
                of the subvalvular apparatus. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for patients with the
                following characteristics/comorbidities: noncalcified aortic annulus; severe ventricular dysfunction
                with ejection fraction < 20%; congenital unicuspid aortic valve; pre-existing prosthetic ring in the
                    tricuspid position; severe mitral annular calcification (MAC); severe (> 3+) mitral insufficiency,
                    or Gorlin syndrome; blood dyscrasias defined as leukopenia (WBC < 3000 cells/mL), acute anemia (Hb <
                        9 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000 cells/mL), or history of bleeding diathesis
                        or coagulopathy; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without obstruction (HOCM);
                        echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation; a known
                        hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), or clopidogrel
                        (Plavix), or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated; significant
                        aortic disease, including abdominal aortic or thoracic aneurysm defined as maximal luminal
                        diameter 5 cm or greater, marked tortuosity (hyperacute bend), aortic arch atheroma (especially
                        if thick [> 5 mm], protruding, or ulcerated) or narrowing (especially with calcification and
                        surface irregularities) of the abdominal or thoracic aorta, severe “unfolding” and tortuosity of
                        the thoracic aorta; access characteristics that would preclude safe placement of the Edwards
                        sheath, such as severe obstructive calcification or severe tortuosity; bulky calcified aortic
                        valve leaflets in close proximity to coronary ostia; a concomitant paravalvular leak where the
                        failing prosthesis is not securely fixed in the native annulus or is not structurally intact
                        (e.g., wireform frame fracture, annuloplasty ring dehiscence); or a partially detached leaflet
                        of the failing bioprosthesis that in the aortic position may obstruct a coronary ostium. For
                        Left axillary approach, a left subclavian takeoff angle ~ ≥ 90° from the aortic arch causes
                        sharp angles, which may be responsible for potential sheath kinking, subclavian/axillary
                        dissection and aortic arch damage. For left/right axillary approach, ensure there is flow in
                        Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA)/Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA) during procedure and
                        monitor pressure in homolateral radial artery. Residual mean gradient may be higher in a
                        “THV-in-failing prosthesis” configuration than that observed following implantation of the valve
                        inside a native aortic annulus using the same size device. Patients with elevated mean gradient
                        post procedure should be carefully followed. It is important that the manufacturer, model and
                        size of the preexisting prosthesis be determined, so that the appropriate valve can be implanted
                        and a prosthesis-patient mismatch be avoided. Additionally, pre-procedure imaging modalities
                        must be employed to make as accurate a determination of the inner diameter as possible.<br><br>
                        <b>Potential Adverse Events:</b>  Potential risks associated with the overall procedure, including
                        potential access complications associated with standard cardiac catheterization, balloon
                        valvuloplasty, the potential risks of conscious sedation and/or general anesthesia, and the use
                        of angiography: death; stroke/transient ischemic attack, clusters, or neurological deficit;
                        paralysis; permanent disability; respiratory insufficiency or respiratory failure; hemorrhage
                        requiring transfusion or intervention; cardiovascular injury including perforation or dissection
                        of vessels, ventricle, atrium, septum, myocardium, or valvular structures that may require
                        intervention; pericardial effusion or cardiac tamponade; thoracic bleeding; embolization
                        including air, calcific valve material, or thrombus; infection including septicemia and
                        endocarditis; heart failure; myocardial infarction; renal insufficiency or renal failure;
                        conduction system defect which may require a permanent pacemaker; arrhythmia; retroperitoneal
                        bleed; arteriovenous (AV) fistula or pseudoaneurysm; reoperation; ischemia or nerve injury or
                        brachial plexus injury; restenosis; pulmonary edema; pleural effusion; bleeding; anemia;
                        abnormal lab values (including electrolyte imbalance); hypertension or hypotension; allergic
                        reaction to anesthesia, contrast media, or device materials; hematoma; syncope; pain or changes
                        (e.g., wound infection, hematoma, and other wound care complications) at the access site;
                        exercise intolerance or weakness; inflammation; angina; heart murmur; and fever. Additional
                        potential risks associated with the use of the valve, delivery system, and/or accessories
                        include: cardiac arrest; cardiogenic shock; emergency cardiac surgery; cardiac failure or low
                        cardiac output; coronary flow obstruction/transvalvular flow disturbance; device thrombosis
                        requiring intervention; valve thrombosis; device embolization; device migration or malposition
                        requiring intervention; left ventricular outflow tract obstruction; valve deployment in
                        unintended location; valve stenosis; structural valve deterioration (wear, fracture,

                leak, migration, embolization, residual gradient (patient-prosthesis mismatch), and/or annular rupture.
                Accelerated deterioration of the valve due to calcific degeneration may occur in children, adolescents,
                or young adults and in patients with an altered calcium metabolism. Prior to delivery, the valve must
                remain hydrated at all times and cannot be exposed to solutions other than its shipping storage solution
                and sterile physiologic rinsing solution. Valve leaflets mishandled or damaged during any part of the
                procedure will require replacement of the valve. Caution should be exercised in implanting a valve in
                patients with clinically significant coronary artery disease. Patients with pre-existing prostheses
                should be carefully assessed prior to implantation of the valve to ensure proper valve positioning and
                deployment. Do not use the valve if the tamper-evident seal is broken or the storage solution does not
                completely cover the valve (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra only), the temperature indicator has been
                activated, the valve is damaged, or the expiration date has elapsed. Do not mishandle the delivery
                system or use it if the packaging or any components are not sterile, have been opened or are damaged
                (e.g., kinked or stretched), or if the expiration date has elapsed. Use of excessive contrast media may
                lead to renal failure. Measure the patient’s creatinine level prior to the procedure. Contrast media
                usage should be monitored. Patient injury could occur if the delivery system is not un-flexed prior to
                removal. Care should be exercised in patients with hypersensitivities to cobalt, nickel, chromium,
                molybdenum, titanium, manganese, silicon, and/or polymeric materials. The procedure should be conducted
                under fluoroscopic guidance. Some fluoroscopically guided procedures are associated with a risk of
                radiation injury to the skin. These injuries may be painful, disfiguring, and long-lasting. Valve
                recipients should be maintained on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy, except when contraindicated, as
                determined by their physician. This device has not been tested for use without anticoagulation. Do not
                add or apply antibiotics to the storage solution (SAPIEN 3 and SAPIEN 3 Ultra only), rinse solution, or
                to the valve. Balloon valvuloplasty should be avoided in the treatment of failing bioprostheses as this
                may result in embolization of bioprosthesis material and mechanical disruption of the valve leaflets. Do
                not perform stand-alone balloon aortic valvuloplasty procedures in the INSPIRIS RESILIA aortic valve for
                the sizes 19-25 mm. This may expand the valve causing aortic incompetence, coronary embolism or annular
                rupture. Transcatheter valve replacement in mitral annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of
                partial annuloplasty ring dehiscence due to high risk of PVL. Transcatheter valve replacement in mitral
                annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of partial (incomplete) annuloplasty rings in the absence
                of annular calcium due to increased risk of valve embolization. Transcatheter valve replacement in
                mitral annuloplasty rings is not recommended in cases of rigid annuloplasty rings due to increased risk
                of PVL or THV deformation.
<br><br>
                <b>Precautions:</b> Long-term durability has not been established for the valve. Regular medical follow-up is
                advised to evaluate valve performance. Limited clinical data are available for transcatheter aortic
                valve replacement in patients with a congenital bicuspid aortic valve who are deemed to be at low
                surgical risk. Anatomical characteristics should be considered when using the valve in this population.
                In addition, patient age should be considered as long-term durability of the valve has not been
                established. Glutaraldehyde may cause irritation of the skin, eyes, nose, and throat. Avoid prolonged or
                repeated exposure to, or breathing of, the solution. Use only with adequate ventilation. If skin contact
                occurs, immediately flush the affected area with water; in the event of contact with eyes, seek
                immediate medical attention. For more information about glutaraldehyde exposure, refer to the Safety
                Data Sheet available from Edwards Lifesciences. If a significant increase in resistance occurs when
                advancing the catheter through the vasculature, stop advancement and investigate the cause of resistance
                before proceeding. Do not force passage, as this could increase the risk of vascular complications. As
                compared to SAPIEN 3, system advancement force may be higher with the use of SAPIEN 3 Ultra/SAPIEN 3
                Ultra RESILIA THV in tortuous/challenging vessel anatomies. To maintain proper valve leaflet coaptation,
                do not overinflate the deployment balloon. Appropriate antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended
                post-procedure in patients at risk for prosthetic valve infection and endocarditis. Additional
                precautions for transseptal replacement of a failed mitral valve bioprosthesis include, the presence of
                devices or thrombus or other abnormalities in the caval vein precluding safe transvenous femoral access
                for transseptal approach; and the presence of an Atrial Septal Occluder Device or calcium preventing
                safe transseptal access. Special care must be exercised in mitral valve replacement to avoid entrapment
                of the subvalvular apparatus. Safety and effectiveness have not been established for patients with the
                following characteristics/comorbidities: noncalcified aortic annulus; severe ventricular dysfunction
                with ejection fraction < 20%; congenital unicuspid aortic valve; pre-existing prosthetic ring in the
                    tricuspid position; severe mitral annular calcification (MAC); severe (> 3+) mitral insufficiency,
                    or Gorlin syndrome; blood dyscrasias defined as leukopenia (WBC < 3000 cells/mL), acute anemia (Hb <
                        9 g/dL), thrombocytopenia (platelet count < 50,000 cells/mL), or history of bleeding diathesis
                        or coagulopathy; hypertrophic cardiomyopathy with or without obstruction (HOCM);
                        echocardiographic evidence of intracardiac mass, thrombus, or vegetation; a known
                        hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin, ticlopidine (Ticlid), or clopidogrel
                        (Plavix), or sensitivity to contrast media, which cannot be adequately premedicated; significant
                        aortic disease, including abdominal aortic or thoracic aneurysm defined as maximal luminal
                        diameter 5 cm or greater, marked tortuosity (hyperacute bend), aortic arch atheroma (especially
                        if thick [> 5 mm], protruding, or ulcerated) or narrowing (especially with calcification and
                        surface irregularities) of the abdominal or thoracic aorta, severe “unfolding” and tortuosity of
                        the thoracic aorta; access characteristics that would preclude safe placement of the Edwards
                        sheath, such as severe obstructive calcification or severe tortuosity; bulky calcified aortic
                        valve leaflets in close proximity to coronary ostia; a concomitant paravalvular leak where the
                        failing prosthesis is not securely fixed in the native annulus or is not structurally intact
                        (e.g., wireform frame fracture, annuloplasty ring dehiscence); or a partially detached leaflet
                        of the failing bioprosthesis that in the aortic position may obstruct a coronary ostium. For
                        Left axillary approach, a left subclavian takeoff angle ~ ≥ 90° from the aortic arch causes
                        sharp angles, which may be responsible for potential sheath kinking, subclavian/axillary
                        dissection and aortic arch damage. For left/right axillary approach, ensure there is flow in
                        Left Internal Mammary Artery (LIMA)/Right Internal Mammary Artery (RIMA) during procedure and
                        monitor pressure in homolateral radial artery. Residual mean gradient may be higher in a
                        “THV-in-failing prosthesis” configuration than that observed following implantation of the valve
                        inside a native aortic annulus using the same size device. Patients with elevated mean gradient
                        post procedure should be carefully followed. It is important that the manufacturer, model and
                        size of the preexisting prosthesis be determined, so that the appropriate valve can be implanted
                        and a prosthesis-patient mismatch be avoided. Additionally, pre-procedure imaging modalities
                        must be employed to make as accurate a determination of the inner diameter as possible.<br><br>
                        <b>Potential Adverse Events:</b>  Potential risks associated with the overall procedure, including
                        potential access complications associated with standard cardiac catheterization, balloon
                        valvuloplasty, the potential risks of conscious sedation and/or general anesthesia, and the use
                        of angiography: death; stroke/transient ischemic attack, clusters, or neurological deficit;
